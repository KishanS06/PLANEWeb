          PLANE is a non-governmental organization (NGO) charity established in
          2010, registered with NGO Bureau in 2014 and itâ€™s based in Fort
          Portal, Kabarole district, Western Uganda. PLANE focuses on general
          health awareness promotion, social security, economic empowerment for
          teenage mothers, and preventing violence against children, human
          rights promotion and mitigating the impact of violence against
          children and the youth and other related interventions. PLANE
          implements programs aimed at educational support to orphans and
          vulnerable children through provision of scholastic materials and
          school dues. It also implements programs for empowering the young
          mothers and rural women through livelihood interventions and it
          greatly supports interventions focusing at gender-based violence
          prevention, sexual reproductive health rights, water, sanitation and
          hygiene for rural communities.

          This website and branch of the organization is dedicated to the
          outreach of Platform for the Needy to the United States of America.
          Promoters include adults and students across the nation, with the
          Ugandan coordinater being Mr.Wadell Steven. Through a branch of the
          organization, there can be an increased spread of awareness, and an
          outlet that can provide funding (more in the donation section below)
          and a chance to expand the organization. Furthermore, operations are
          being taken to spread the organization through contacting local
          pastors across the nation for a chance of support for the
          underpriveleged individuals in Uganda. Since individuals in the region
          of Uganda are susceptible to many genetically-based disorders and
          diseases, there is increased prevalence of stunted children and
          strains of cancer, which requires interventions that derive from
          international fronts.

        increased rate of fatal diseases, with no implied causal relationship.
